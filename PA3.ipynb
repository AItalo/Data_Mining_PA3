    "* ID *(integer)*: Index of the dataset. Counting numbers starting at 0.\n",
    "* Gender *(string)*: Gender of the patient, \"M\" for male and \"F\" for female.\n",
    "* Age *(integer)*: Age of the patient in years\n",
    "* Marital Status *(string)*: Description of the patient's marital status.\n",
    "* RIC *(integer)*: RIC of the patient assigned according to [Appendix B in the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services IRF-PAI training manual.](https://www.cms.gov/medicare/medicare-fee-for-service-payment/inpatientrehabfacpps/downloads/irfpai-manual-2012.pd)\n",

    "    * The tasks are categorized as either motor (13 tasks) or cognitive (5 tasks). Each task is scored on a 7-point ordinal scale to measure independence as determined by the amount of assistance required to perform each ADL task.\n",

    "In order to clean the data, we must first see what data is initially available. To do this, I first iterated through the dataset and put the marital status of each entry into a set. This ensures uniqueness, and allows me to see a shortened list of each different possible entry in the dataset without having to see all 4.5 thousand entries. I then restrict each entry to only ascii letters and cast each string into its lowercase form, which eliminates errors such as a trailing period or the difference between \"married\", \"Married\", and \"mARRIED\", all of which show up in the raw data. From here, entries are generally one of two categories: Typos, as in \"marrired\" instead of \"married\", or variations on a classification, such as \"unmarried\" or \"single\" for \"never married.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "To deal with typos, I've implemented several rules that cover each typo case in the generated set. These are rules such as strings containing \"wid\" are cast to \"widowed\", strings containing \"marr\" or \"ried\" but **not** containing \"never\" being cast to \"married\", etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dealing with variations and unique entries was more difficult, and required rules that were more specific to the dataset. For example, I saw that the set contained \"wife\" and \"so\", meaning significant other. So, I cast these to \"married\". Or, in one case, an entry was of the form \"d x 5 years\", denoting that the patient was divorced for 5 years. In this case, I implemented the rule that if the first letter of the status is \"d\", it will be cast to \"divorced\". The trickiest of these was \"never married\", as there were several different ways physicians indicated this, including \"single\", \"girlfriend\", \"engaged\", \"no\", etc. Because of this, I implemented a catch-all rule as a base case, where if the given status is not cast based on one of the earlier rules, it is automatically determined to be \"never married.\" While this could cause problems if the dataset is expanded, I tested the generated set with all the previous rules implemented and all of the remaining variances were different ways of indicating \"never married\", so in this case the explicit rules are enough that this base case does do what we want it to do.

I expected to never get an \"Error\" printout, but to my surprise there were 5. Exploring further, I printed out the ID of each of these instances, as well as what their RIC was, and was very confused when each of the errored values was a string. Going back, I realized that when I split each instance into it's elements in `create_dataset()`, it was also splitting cases in which the Marital Status contained a comma, and so the problem wasn't that the RIC was entered improperly, but that the element at index 4 of the instance was the second part of the marital status attribute.\n",
